The is a basic framework to quickly build and test replication algorithms.
It has basic mechanism to establish request-response and message passing communication
between replicas. It also has test utilities to quickly form a cluster of replicas,
introduce network failures and assert on the state of the replicas.
This repo has example code for the distributed system workshop.
