# Repo Structure 

### Replicate 
 - This repo has all the code samples related to distributed algorithms. 
 - All the algos needs to be studies from this repo. 

### Durable Cache MS
 - This repo will have implementation of algorithms that are discussed in Replicate repo.
 - As the very first task , **Write Ahead Log** (WAL) is implemented.
